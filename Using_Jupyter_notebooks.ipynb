    "We've displayed our data as a table, but a chart would be easier to interpret at a glance. There are a number of charting and data visualisation packages available for Python, here we'll be using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/). You just feed Altair a dataframe, and tell it the columns to display on each axis. Let's start with a simple bar chart that shows the keywords along the `x` axis, and the number of search results on the `y` axis."
